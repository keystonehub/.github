## 🚀 Why Create Keystone?

Keystone started as an idea to solve an in-house challenge: 
Having both paid and free resources listed seemed like a smart idea, but over time this has caused unnecessary bloat and increased the amount of support needed for free content. 
This extra support time directly takes away from the dedicated support customers deserve.

To address this, we had some discussions about creating a dedicated open-source hub. 
The idea is simple: provide a home for free open-source resources—either branded under Keystone *('key_')* or left unbranded entirely *('fivem_')* while keeping them separate from paid releases.
This separation allows us creators to continue contributing to the community without compromising the experience for paying customers.

Keystone is a collaborative space for developers and creators to share, improve, and build resources that benefit the FiveM community. 
It’s a place where free open-source tools and scripts can thrive, with community-driven support and collaboration at its core.
